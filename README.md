# NIRMAN Inter-College Hackathon – Smart Campus Solutions

This repository contains all the features and solutions developed as part of the NIRMAN Inter-College Hackathon.
The project focuses on solving real-world campus problems such as overcrowding, long waiting times, and inefficient resource usage using technology and machine learning.

# Problem Statement

In college campuses, students often face:

  1.Long queues at Xerox/Copy Centers

  2.Heavy crowding at canteens

  3.Insufficient break time due to food preparation delays

This project aims to optimize time, reduce crowding, and improve student convenience by introducing smart preordering and crowd prediction systems.



#Features Implemented

1️. Xerox Preordering System

A smart solution to avoid overcrowding at Xerox/Copy Centers.

#Key Highlights:

Students can prebook Xerox/printing requests through the application
Eliminates long queues and waiting time
Helps the Xerox center manage orders efficiently
Students can collect prints directly when ready

Outcome:
* Reduced crowd
* Faster service
* Better resource management

2. Canteen Crowd Management System (ML-based)

An intelligent system to predict crowd availability in college canteens.

How it works:
Uses day-wise and canteen-wise crowd data
Trains a Machine Learning model on historical data
Predicts crowd levels for different time slots

Benefits:

* Students can choose less crowded canteens
* Helps avoid peak-time rush
* Enables better planning for both students and canteen staff

3. Pre-Food Booking System for Canteens

A preordering solution to ensure students get food on time during short breaks.

#Problem Solved:
Students often waste 15–20 minutes waiting for food
Limited break duration makes it difficult to eat on time

Solution:
Students can preorder food before reaching the canteen
Food is prepared in advance
Orders are ready upon arrival

Advantages:
Saves time during lunch/breakfast
Reduces in-canteen crowding
Improves overall dining experience
